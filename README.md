This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Haskell program related to a type-unsafe Show instance for the Either type. The bug arises from the use of FlexibleInstances without proper type constraints, potentially leading to compiler errors or runtime exceptions depending on the specific usage. The solution provides a corrected implementation with stricter type constraints, ensuring type safety.
